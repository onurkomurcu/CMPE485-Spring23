#### Notes : 
- Bowling ball can be controlled with 'WASD' or arrow keys.
- The first cube that player went through at the beginning has continuous force to left and drag of this cube is higher. As a result, this cube is falling down slowly and moving to the left of the platform.
- When the player presses 'space' key, the cube is spawning. Since player is pressing space key multiple times, so many cubes are spawned from original cube and spawned cubes as well. It can be seen from the video.

## Gameplay of HW#2

#### Notes : 
- There are another way to escape. There is one extra floor above the current floor. There is only 1 door and key is also compatible with this door. However, only 1 door is compatible with key in the current floor. Bounciness of the floor is high because of this. 
- Controller behave little bit different to increase difficulty of the game.
