#### Notes : 
- Bowling ball can be controlled with 'WASD' or arrow keys.
- The first cube that player went through at the beginning has continuous force to left and drag of this cube is higher. As a result, this cube is falling down slowly and moving to the left of the platform.
- When the player is pressing 'space' key, the cube is spawning. Since player is pressing space key multiple times, so many cubes are spawned from original cube and spawned cubes as well. It can be seen from the video.
